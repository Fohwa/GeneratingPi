Just some simpel code to generate pi in an interesting way.
It is not really efficient, but cool.
Basicly it generates random numbers between 0 and 1.
These are coordinates of a 2d square.
in the square is a quarter circle.
If the point has a distance to 0/0 of less than 1, it is in the circle. With the ration of points you can calculate pi
